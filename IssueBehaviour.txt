Behaviour:

After changing the ProjectMembership name calculation from using "abbrev" to use to_s ....

  def name
    ret = ""
    ret += self.user.abbrev
    ret += " as "
    ret += self.role.abbrev
    ret += " in "
    ret += self.project.abbrev
  end

--->

  def name
    ret = ""
    ret += self.user.to_s
    ret += " as "
    ret += self.role.to_s
    ret += " in "
    ret += self.project.abbrev
  end

the web stops crashing, but in the aside column, when acting_user is not "admin" we see:

Project memberships
Txinto Vaz as Systems Engineer in test
as in test

This is, it appears a second card, (nothing) as (nothing) in test

If we change the user to administrator, this "phantom card" dissappears.
